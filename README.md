## 📦 Available Prompts

### 1. 🦾 voidBeastMode (v1.0) — First Release

**voidBeastMode** is our flagship agent workflow prompt for robust, autonomous problem-solving.  
Inspired by [Beast Mode by burkeholland](https://gist.github.com/burkeholland) 🐲, voidBeastMode is designed for agents that never quit until the task is thoroughly solved and every box is checked.

#### Key Features

- 🤖 Autonomous, iterative resolution with explicit planning and validation
- 🗺️ Step-by-step public todo lists, checked off as progress is made
- 🔍 Deep codebase investigation (reads 2000 lines at a time)
- 🔬 Incremental, test-driven development and debugging
- 🧩 Special deep research, analyzer, and checkpointing modes
- 📝 Transparent progress and reporting

#### Example Workflow

```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Understand the user request.
- [ ] Step 2: Investigate relevant code and files.
- [ ] Step 3: Develop a detailed plan to solve the issue.
- [ ] Step 4: Implement the solution step-by-step.
- [ ] Step 5: Test and validate after each change.
- [ ] Step 6: Reflect and document the solution.
```

#### Usage

Use voidBeastMode as a template for AI agents (e.g., Copilot, GPT) in any codebase or automation project that demands high standards for rigor, planning, and reliability.
